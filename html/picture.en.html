                    Here we would like you to see the children's daily play. We hope that you will come up with new play by knowing how to play other children. Also, we are pleased if you have a sense of closeness that everyone likes to enjoy even if the country is different.

                <h3>Slide for the ball made with KAPLA</h3>
                   <p>It was a place that they would make it by challenging many times. Even only making a slide was struggling with crashing by halfway, but they were working hard without giving up. Since the appearance is also on the video page, please see it.

                <h3>To be friend with the dinosaur</h3>
                    <p>A dinosaur exhibition held for a limited time at a neighborhood park. Where we draw pictures of dinosaurs, where we listen to voices, we were crowded with families with child slide. This photo shows a popular area because it was possible to ride a dinosaur.</p>

                <h3>Seems to catch up with everyone's back</h3>
                   <p>This day was a birthday party for children. Some boys were smaller than them, but they were playing along well together. It is safe for adults that there is something that they can calm down where they are not allowed to run around in the room.</p>

                   <p>They were making a railroad track, they were glad that they were able to make it long, they lifted it, and they said "we did it, we did it!", but...one side was heavy and it fell down.</p>

                <h3>Long time no see snowing</h3>
                   <p>When they went to play at my grandmother's house, there was a lot of snow and they were delighted. The same thing the child likes to play snow anywhere, no difference among children.</p>

                <h3>Sukiyaki party</h3>
                   <p>When I came over there, we made a Japanese cuisine and did a Sukiyaki party. Because everytime speaking of Japan, there was only the image of sushi. So they were suprised" There are also such things in Japan!" I was pleased. It was nice to see they were trying to use chopsticks.</p>
